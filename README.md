This is a remake of the popular game Wordle which I made because I was bored as hell.
What is Wordle? If you have never played [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), what are you doing here?

How does it work? IDK, read the code.

Essentially if you look at the files there's a little file called "words.txt" which has 500 5-letter words I stole from a random website. Trust me, I am not creative enough to come up with 500 5-letter words.

The program (wordle.py) then looks inside the file and puts it in an array and then randomly selects one of the word from the 500 words so that the player can then struggle to find the word! How exciting :3

Anyway, here is a screenshot of how it works:
